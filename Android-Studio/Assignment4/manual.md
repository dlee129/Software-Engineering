Prerequisites:
Android Studio SDK
Java SDK
Android Phone is preferably easier to use but not necessary

Installation:
1. Download Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
2. Install Android Studio on your local machine (use recommended settings unless you know exactly what you want)
3. After installation is complete, go to open project and look for the TipCalculator app. (It will have the android studio icon next to it)
4. Before going any further, make sure your android device has developer mode on. If it doesnt, go to your phone' settings and tap on the build number
a couple of times until developer mode is unlocked.
5. Those who had Androids, connect your phone while turning on USB debugging, go to the run scree and then skip to step 8.
6. If you have an iPhone, you will need to make use of the virtual devices. In order to do that, inside Android Studio, go to run and then it will ask for a list of 
devices. There is a button for the option to Create New Virtual Device and click it.
7. You will be redirected to a window that will ask you what kind of specs you want your virtual device to have and keep going through until it is finished. When
you are finished, your virtual device will now appear on the list of devices to use to run the app
8. Once you run the app, it will open and then you can use the app's full functionality.

Running Tests:
As for tests, for invalid or empty values, a message will appear telling you that the values are invalid and nothing will be computed from pressing the Compute Tip button.

TipCalculator App was built with Android Studio Version 2.3.3.
